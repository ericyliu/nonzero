# Longevity
*“The first wealth is health.”* - Ralph Waldo Emerson
Eternal youth is perhaps the longest sought after goal in history. While living forever may not be possible today, significantly extending our life and health spans relative to the average certainly does seem possible.

It’s not hard to find people who look and feel 40, even though they’re only 30. On the other hand we can find people age 30 who look and feel like they’re 40.

This entry is aimed at those looking to extend the length of time they have on this planet and end up in that latter category.

# Start with the basics

When it comes to living longer, it can feel overwhelming deciding where to start; human health is one of the most complicated and polarizing areas of knowledge. The trick is to find studies that are reproducible and verified by trusted sources. Focus on the methods that take minimal risks while maximizing health gain.

There’s an overwhelming number of fad diets, novel drugs, and medical procedures that sound completely science fiction.

Spending $2 million a year and making extreme lifestyle sacrifices may help us maximize our life spans (e.g. Bryan Johnson), but luckily for most of us, there are severely diminishing returns when it comes to longevity efforts.

This may change, but as of today, there is no evidence that miracle drugs or fancy treatments can outweigh the power of a healthy diet and lifestyle. Similarly, the longest lived populations in the world are often low-technology and materially quite poor ([see the "Blue Zones"](https://www.bluezones.com/about/history/)).

The fact is that our modern lifestyle is so unhealthy, that simply avoiding basic health mistakes nearly everyone is making can be enough to make significant gains in longevity without ever edging into the science-fiction or extremist health-nut territory.

We can get a majority of the way to optimizing our longevity potential by sticking “to the basics” and applying them consistently.

There are five core pillars we should follow:
- sleep well
- eat a largely plant-based, whole foods (perishes on a shelf) diet
- avoid long sedentary periods and have periods of prolonged heart rate elevation each day (exercise)
- have good social ties
- avoid prolonged periods of high stress

How many people do you know who do ALL of these consistently?

The good news is, these are all probably things that you already know are important, and that feel good to do when done regularly.
