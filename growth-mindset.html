<p><em>“Becoming is better than being.”</em> - Carol Dweck</p>

<h2 id="the-first-step-to-growth-is-understanding-that-we-can-grow">The first step to growth is understanding that we can grow.</h2>

<p>When we were born, we were immobile. We then learned to crawl, with walking closely after and finally we could run. This is as true for running as it is for biking as it is for swimming. This is true for playing the piano or using a computer. This is even true for how we socialize and pursue our goals in life. We are not static machines, doomed to a life of wear and tear, performing the same function from birth until death. Every human is innately capable of growth and it is merely the ability and circumstances to grow effectively that limits us.</p>

<h2 id="we-are-not-defined-by-any-single-performance">We are not defined by any single performance.</h2>

<p>It’s common for us to connect our value as performers to how we did in a single performance. We just made the crowd go wild? What stars we must be! We misplayed a bunch of notes and it was a bad performance? We must be terrible artists. But the truth is, we are so much more than just one performance. The best in their fields know not to let one bad performance or one bad match define them. That’s because failure is one of the best resources to learn from. Each misstep gives us a new data point for how <em>not</em> to do something, which puts us one step closer to knowing how <em>to</em> do it.</p>

<h2 id="food-for-thought">Food for Thought</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Michael Jordan has missed more shots than we’ve ever shot.</li>
  <li>People generally only remember and judge us based on how well we did last.</li>
  <li>If we think we are smart when we ace a test, then it follows we’re stupid if we don’t ace a test. (So don’t think this way)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Self-awareness Journaling
    <ol>
      <li>Perform an activity you are bad at or embarrassed by</li>
      <li>Write down how you feel afterwards and what you could’ve done better on</li>
      <li>Repeat 5 times</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Reframing judgmental thoughts
    <ol>
      <li>“I’ll never be able to do X” → “If I practice X, I’ll be able to do it”</li>
      <li>“I’m so smart” → “I did so well”</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="success-metrics">Success Metrics</h2>

<ol>
  <li>I view failure as a chance to get better</li>
  <li>I judge my performances instead of myself</li>
</ol>
