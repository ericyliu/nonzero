## What is procrastination

Choosing short term rewards over working towards higher value or long term goals. Procrastination is inherently a failure of navigating your motivational system.

The formula above represents the motivation that you feel as a factor of a few concepts. The most important takeaway is to consider what is on top versus what is on bottom. To give yourself more motivation, either increase what is on top or decrease what is on bottom.

### improve these
Probability of Success - how likely you believe you are to accomplish the task
Perceived Reward - how much you think you stand to gain from accomplishing this task

### reduce these
Perceived Effort - how hard the task seems
Impulsiveness - how likely are you to succumb to short term desire by nature
Delay - how long before you get the reward for doing the task
Distractibility - how likely something will pull you away from the task

## How to deal with it

1. Define your values so you know what you want to work towards
2. Reduce friction in doing what you need to do (reduces perceived effort)
3. Increase friction and reduce availability of distractions (reduces distractibility)
4. break down tasks into trivially easy steps (reduces perceived effort, decreases delay)
5. Adopt a process mindset and enjoy the journey (increases perceived reward)
6. Keep momentum by consistently doing these tasks on a regular schedule (makes your impulse to do that task)
7. Avoid perfectionist mindset (increase probability of success)

## Exercises

1. Write down what your values are and what you are trying to accomplish
2. Take something you are trying to accomplish that you are putting off and break it down into smaller tasks
