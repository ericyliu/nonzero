## What is procrastination?

Procrastination is choosing short-term rewards over working toward higher-value, long-term goals. At its core, it represents a failure to effectively navigate your motivational system.

The formula above captures the motivation you feel as a function of several key factors. The crucial insight is to focus on what's in the numerator versus what's in the denominator. To boost your motivation, either increase what's on top or decrease what's on the bottom.

### Increase these factors:
- **Probability of Success** - How likely you believe you are to accomplish the task
- **Perceived Reward** - How much you think you stand to gain from accomplishing this task

### Reduce these factors:
- **Perceived Effort** - How difficult the task appears to be
- **Impulsiveness** - Your natural tendency to succumb to short-term desires
- **Delay** - How long you must wait before receiving the reward for completing the task
- **Distractibility** - How likely external factors are to pull you away from the task

## How to overcome procrastination

1. **Clarify your values** - Define what truly matters to you so you know what you're working toward
2. **Reduce friction** - Make it easier to start and continue doing what you need to do (reduces perceived effort)
3. **Create barriers to distraction** - Increase friction around distractions and reduce their availability (reduces distractibility)
4. **Break tasks into micro-steps** - Divide large tasks into trivially easy steps (reduces perceived effort, decreases delay)
5. **Adopt a process mindset** - Learn to enjoy the journey itself (increases perceived reward)
6. **Build momentum through consistency** - Establish regular schedules for important tasks (transforms them into automatic habits)
7. **Embrace imperfection** - Avoid perfectionist thinking that paralyzes progress (increases probability of success)

## Practical exercises

1. **Values clarification** - Write down your core values and the specific goals you're trying to accomplish
2. **Task decomposition** - Take one thing you're putting off and break it down into the smallest possible actionable steps

## Success indicators

1. You no longer delay important tasks until the last minute
2. Making progress toward your values no longer feels daunting or overwhelming
