<p><em>“The rider is our conscious reasoning … The elephant is the other 99 percent of mental processes … that actually govern most of our behavior.”</em> — Jonathan Haidt</p>

<h2 id="who-we-really-are">Who we really are.</h2>

<p>We might think of ourselves as logical machines taking in our surroundings and making rational decisions, but no matter how cold and calculating we may be, it is undeniable that most of our decisions are heavily influenced by our more primal, animalistic side.</p>

<p>The elephant and the rider is an analogy proposed by psychologist Jonathan Haidt, that suggests every person is a combination of these two components.</p>

<p>This is a useful framing as it suggests our emotions have a much larger influence on our behavior than our logical selves might like to think. Just like an elephant, our emotions are a powerful, sometimes unbridled force that, at times, can completely disregard the rider, even if the rider is pulling as hard as they can.</p>

<p>The elephant is simply too powerful to ignore. Instead of trying to exert perfect and complete control over our elephants, it might be more adaptive for us to find ways to co-exist alongside them by learning techniques to soothe, listen to, and when needed, subtly re-direct these powerful inner forces.</p>

<h2 id="self-care">Self care.</h2>

<p>There are certain things that drive elephants crazy. Ever heard of HALT? Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired. Anytime these are in play, we should be aware that our elephants will likely be more sensitive than usual.</p>

<p>To take care of ourselves is to take care of the elephant. If the elephant is not in tip-top shape, it will be much harder to work with. This could manifest as (but not limited to) being hangry or depressed. Luckily, taking care of ourselves is very simple, and doing the following will increase our capacity to coexist with our emotions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sleep</li>
  <li>Eat well</li>
  <li>Exercise</li>
  <li>Socialize</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-not-to-do">What not to do:</h2>

<p>When thinking of how to best deal with our emotions, it’s easier to start with what NOT to do. Here are two common dysfunctional ways we tend to deal with our emotions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Surrender</strong>: giving into our emotions to the point where they cause us to take action that causes more harm than good. i.e. hitting someone out of anger</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Avoidance</strong>: ignoring our emotions, and giving ourselves appropriate time to process. i.e. numbing ourselves with drugs or distractions in an attempt to avoid negative feelings</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-to-do">What to do:</h2>

<p>Following these steps will allow us to avoid getting totally lost in our emotions while still enabling us to listen to and benefit from the valuable wisdom they may have to offer.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Get space</strong>: When the elephant is riled up, it’s much more tempting to pursue surrender or avoidance strategies. Taking a breath and calming our systems down will help us from being overwhelmed and gives us time for the rider to enter into the picture in a healthy way.  Catching ourselves when we’re “flooded” and getting the space we need is not easy to do, but is a skill like riding a bike; the more we do it, the better we get at it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Identify the emotion</strong>: Once we are more level-headed, identifying what we are feeling is important for us to pursue the right strategy. The more specific we get in identifying our emotions, by naming them, the more effective the next steps become. This can be as simple as “I’m feeling stressed”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ask “why do I feel this way?” or “what is this trying to tell me?”</strong>: Emotions are signals our body and brain are sending to us to take action. Exploring with open-ended questions allows us to identify what valuable guidance these signals are trying to share with us.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Evaluate and take action</strong>: Once we know what emotion we’re feeling and what it might be trying to tell us, now we can decide the course of action our rider and elephant should take. The important part is that we’ve neither blindly surrendered to our emotion, nor fully numbed ourselves and ignored the emotion. It is much more likely now that our ultimate behavior will be much more intentional.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="how-to-work-with-others">How to work with others:</h2>

<p>Sometimes, a friend or significant other is the one in a highly emotional state. Both good and bad strategies apply when we are helping others, just as it does for ourselves.</p>

<h3 id="dont">Don’t:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Let them vent and be drawn more into the emotion (surrender)</li>
  <li>Give advice surrounding the material conditions (avoidance)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="do">Do:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Help them get some space if their emotions are highly intense</li>
  <li>Help them identify what they are feeling</li>
  <li>Help them identify why they are feeling the way they do</li>
  <li>If prompted, we can provide advice on what action to take once they are in a lower emotional state</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="some-general-tips-to-achieve-these-steps-are">Some general tips to achieve these steps are:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Asking open-ended questions to help them process</li>
  <li>Reframing the situation to be less upsetting</li>
  <li>Exercises:</li>
  <li>Journal after highly emotional moments. Note what you were feeling and what caused those feelings</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="success-indicators">Success Indicators:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I am able to process and respond to my own emotions</li>
  <li>I am able to help others navigate their emotions</li>
</ul>
