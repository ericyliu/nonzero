## Introduction

We were told to follow the path - school, career, success - and things would work out.

But now we’re burned out.

Lonely in big cities.

Anxious after meditating.

Stay up doomscrolling and wake up tired.

Hustling hard and unsure why.

This isn't working.

## 🔥 What’s Broken

Religion gave us rules, but abandoned reason.

Politics gave us tribes, but left us divided.

Philosophy asked big questions, but ignored real problems.

## 💡 A New Way to Think

We believe the good life isn’t a fixed formula.

It’s something you build—through reflection, conversation, and real-world testing.

Not alone. But together.

We’re not here to debate abstract ideals.

**We’re here to ask better questions, and test the answers in real life.**

## 🤝 What We’re Doing About It

Once a week. One hour.

A group of thoughtful people exploring how to live better.

We talk about the stuff that actually matters—

**Health, money, meaning, relationships, purpose.**

Not just ideas, but actions.

Each week ends with one small, concrete step to test in your real life.

We don’t pretend to have the answers.

But we care enough to ask the right questions—and try things together.

## 🚀 Take the First Step

Try it for a week.

**Just one hour, one conversation, one step forward.**

You’ll know if it’s what you’ve been missing.
