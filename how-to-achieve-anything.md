# How To Achieve Anything

*“Without strategy, execution is aimless. Without execution, strategy is useless.”* - Morris Chang, Founder of TSMC

For nearly every starting position in life, there are examples of people who ended up in prison or dead from an overdose; and others who rose above to become successful athletes, entrepreneurs, or creators living fulfilling, generative lives.

When we control for factors outside our influence (such as starting position and luck), the key difference between the miserable and the successful comes down to **the actions they take**.

There are two primary failure modes when it comes to achieving anything worthwhile:

- **Strategic failure:** You didn’t take the correct actions because you pursued the wrong ones.
- **Execution failure:** You knew the correct actions, but you didn’t take them.


The most meaningful goals require managing the balance between these two failure modes: devoting enough time and attention to a good enough strategy, while consistently applying actions aligned with that strategy.

## Strategy vs. Execution

Each of us tends to lean more toward one side: strategy or execution. You may recognize these archetypes in your own life: a brilliant friend who underperforms their potential, or someone who works tirelessly but never seems to “move the needle.”

### Signs you’re too focused on execution

- You feel busy and overwhelmed.
- You often feel lost or question, “What is this all for?”

### Signs you’re too focused on strategy

- You have great ideas but few tangible results.
- You’re always preparing, never starting.

Whatever your natural tendency, it’s crucial to balance the two. A large deficit in either will be hard to overcome.

We can represent this balance with a simple equation:

**Output = Strategy × Execution**

The equation is multiplicative because a complete lack of either one—strategy or execution—reduces output to zero.

Once you identify your personal tendency, the most efficient improvement often comes from strengthening the underdeveloped side.

## Practical Ways to Strengthen Strategy

- Journal to reflect on what you did and whether it moved you closer to your goal.
- Spend time at the start of the day, week, or month outlining concrete next steps.

## Practical Ways to Strengthen Execution

- Start small (see Procrastination article).
- Focus on consistency over one-time heroic efforts.
- Set up your environment and mindset to make action easier.

## Exercises

- Plan your day each morning with a clear task list.
- Journal at night to reflect on wins and areas for improvement.
- Choose one repeatable action you can take daily and turn it into a habit.

## Success Indicators

- I am getting things done.
- The things I get done meaningfully advance my goals.
- I am continuously refining my balance between strategy and execution.

## Striving For More Optimal Balance

The ideal balance depends on the task at hand. Complex tasks require more strategy; simple, labor-intensive tasks demand more execution. A rough way to gauge complexity is by how long the task will take to complete. Booking a dinner reservation requires minimal strategy, while building a million-dollar business requires deep thought and planning because it unfolds over many years.

### A finer point

Long-term goals (like building a business) demand strong strategy. However, that doesn’t mean you should get stuck in preparation or theory. Often, the fastest way to discover the right strategy is through **a lot of execution with rapid feedback loops**.
